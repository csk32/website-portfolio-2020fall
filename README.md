You can find my project by going to the docs folder and the homepage is titled "index.html". My website features a week's worth of quick and easy dinners. As someone who is a foodie, this has been a really fun project for me. On the main page, you will find a header with active links that will take you to all of the other pages; taking on the form of a navigation bar. The homepage also includes a description, photo, and link for all of the different meals. The meals include: chicken tortilla soup, sloppy joe casserole, tuna lime tostadas, super simple salmon, pork chops with fresh tomato, onion, garlic, and feta, quick beef stir-fry, and BBQ chicken chopped salad. The recipe pages, on the other hand, have another description, the serving size, the prep time, the cook time, and total time. They also obviously include the ingredients and step-by-step directions.
