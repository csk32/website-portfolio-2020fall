My website features a week's worth of quick and easy dinners. As someone who is a foodie, this has be a really fun project for me. So far, I have created the 
homepage as well as two other pages that have the recipes. I additionally added in pictures and linked the homepage to the other meals.
The homepage so far includes all seven meals for the week, an image to show how it looks, a link (for some of them) to view the recipe, and a quick description of each meal.
The recipe pages, on the other hand, have another description, the serving size, the prep time, the cook time, and total time. 
They also obviously include the ingredients and step-by-step directions. I might go back and add in images for each step, but we will see what happens.
I already have plans to add a lot of different CSS to all of the different pages as well as buttons to navigate between them. I also need to finish making the other 5 recipe pages.
