      chicken tortilla soup</a>.</p>
    <p>Ready in about 30 minutes. I've made it many times, with various small
      changes. It works best with leftover precooked chicken and is super
      easy to make. Also cooks best in a crock-pot, just add everything in
      and cook on high for a few hours.</p>

    <h3>Day 2: Sloppy Joe Casserole</h3>

    <p>Preparation only takes 15 minutes. It's a huge hit and you can add
      chili powder for a little extra spice. I always have all the ingredients
      for this at home. Great recipe and really fun to make!</p>

    <p>Ready in 35 minutes. This recipe has a great amount of taste with
      a small amount of work. The balsamic blends so well with the garlic,
      onion, and tomatoes. The feta on top is like icing on the cake!</p>

      pork chops with fresh tomato, onion, garlic, and feta</a>.</p>
    <p>Ready in 25 minutes. Quick and healthy meal that looks and tastes like
      a fancy one. This is great for students (like me) because we can switch
      out or add different veggies or meat that we already have. It is very
      hard to mess up this one.  </p>

    <h3>Day 7: BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad</h3>
